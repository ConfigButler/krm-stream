# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-07-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `gateway.RedactedPlaceholder` is removed, and a redacted value is no longer present on the wire in any form. A consumer that rendered the placeholder from the object must render it from `redactedPaths` instead (the TS client exposes `store.redactedPaths(uid)`). No back-compat shim: there are no users yet, and keeping the landmine around to be polite to nobody would be the whole mistake repeated.

### Features

* add KRM resource streaming library ([#1](https://github.com/ConfigButler/krm-stream/issues/1)) ([f415a97](https://github.com/ConfigButler/krm-stream/commit/f415a97023a75b20a88436c483eca564b991fe85))
* seed krm-stream — protocol, conformance corpus, both skeletons ([0f5c65b](https://github.com/ConfigButler/krm-stream/commit/0f5c65b89bd543da51a8636fb6f993c49479c400))
